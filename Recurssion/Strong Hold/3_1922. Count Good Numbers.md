# 1922. Count Good Numbers

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-numbers/)

## Approach - Brute Force Approach

1. we have even digits are 0, 2, 4,6, 8
2. we have prime digits are 2, 3, 5, 7
3. At every even index we have five possibilites
4. At every odd index we have four possibilites
5. take ans as 1, at every even index multiply ans with 5
6. and at every odd index multiply ans with 4
7. apply modulo at every iteration to avoid overflow
8. return the answer

```Java



int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
        
        
        long long ans = 1;    //TLE
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(i%2 == 0)
                ans *= 5;
            else {
                ans *= 4;
            }
            
            ans %= mod;
        }
        
        return (int)ans;
}

```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(n) 

### Space Complexity: O(1)


## Optimized 

1. From above approach, we know that, there are even = n/2 + n%2 even number of indices are there in 0 to n.
2. and odd = n/2 odd indices are there
3. So that, we can simply calculate the number of good string  like power(5, even) * power(4, odd)
4. apply modulo whenever it is neccessary



```Java


class Solution {
public:
    
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    
    long long power(long long x, long long n) {
        if(n == 0)
            return 1;
        
        long long ans = power(x, n/2);
        ans *= ans;
        ans %= mod;
        if(n%2) ans *= x;
        ans %= mod;
        
        return ans;
    }
    
    int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
        
        long long odd = n/2;
        long long even = n/2 + n%2;
        
        return (power(5, even)*power(4, odd))%mod;    
    }
};

```
