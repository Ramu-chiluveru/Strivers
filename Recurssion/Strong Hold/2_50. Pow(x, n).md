# 50. Pow(x, n)

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

## Approach - Brute Force

1. let say, 2^5 is shown as => 2*2*2*2*2
2. The term x is multiplied n times
3. Implement the same thing in the code


```Java

class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        
        if(x == 1)
            return (double)1;
            
        
        double ans = 1;
        bool neg = false;
        long nn = n;

        if(n < 0) {
            neg = true;
            nn = -nn;
        }
            

        
        for(long i=0; i<nn; i++) {
            ans = ans*x;
        }
        
        if(neg == true)
            return 1/ans;
        
        return ans;
        
        
        
        
    }
};


```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(n) 

### Space Complexity: O(1)


## Optimal Approach

1. In this approach, we will multiply the x for n times, instead we will checkout the even n.
2. Let's see, if 2^5, then we can write it as 2^4 * 2^1
3. As n = 4 is even, we simply write it as (2^2 * 2^2) = 16
4. The same approach we will follow, if we found odd n, then multiply answer with x and decrement -1 from n
5. If we found even n, then multiply x with itself ans store in x and decrement n by n/2
6. Finally return the answer

```Java

class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        
        double ans = 1.0;
        
        long nn = n;
        
        if(nn < 0) {
            nn = -nn;
        }
        
        while(nn > 0) {
            if(nn%2 == 1) {
                ans = ans * x;
                nn--;
            }
            
            else {
                x = x*x;
                nn = nn/2;
            } 
        }
        
        if(n < 0) return (double)1/(double)ans;
        
        return ans;
    }

};

```
