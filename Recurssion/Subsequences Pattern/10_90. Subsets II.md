# 90. Subsets II

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

## Approach - 1

1. implement pick and not pick case, to avoid duplicate values, use set

```Java

class Solution {
public:
    
    void subSet(int index, vector<int> &nums, vector<int> &curr, set<vector<int>> &st) {
        if(index == nums.size()) {
            st.insert(curr);
            return;
        }
        
        
        curr.push_back(nums[index]);
        subSet(index + 1, nums, curr, st);
        curr.pop_back();
        
        subSet(index + 1, nums, curr, st);
        
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        set<vector<int>> st;
        vector<int> curr;
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        
        subSet(0, nums, curr, st);
        
        
        
        for(auto &it : st) {
            ans.push_back(it);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};


```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O( 2^n *(k log (x) ))
2^n  for generating every subset and k* log( x)  to insert every combination of average length k in a set of size x. After this, we have to convert the set of combinations back into a list of list /vector of vectors which takes more time.

### Space Complexity:  O(2^n * k)
to store every subset of average length k. Since we are initially using a set to store the answer another O(2^n *k) is also used.



## Approach - 2

1. In this approach, we only focused to pick an element.
2. Here we need to observe is that, We can start the subset from any index either 0, 1, 2,3 or n-1
3. So for every recurssion, do a for loop from current index to n, 
4. To avoid duplicate subsequences first we sort the given array and we check in the loop if the last picked element is equal to current element and current index `i` should greater than index. In this case we don't pick the current element.
5. Now we pick the element
6. Every time, we pick an element, we push that array to ans to get all subsets

```Java

   void subSet1(int index, vector<int> nums, vector<int> &curr, vector<vector<int>> &ans) {
        
        ans.push_back(curr);
        
        for(int i=index; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            if(i > index && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue;
            
            curr.push_back(nums[i]);
            
            subSet1(i + 1, nums, curr, ans);
            curr.pop_back();
        }
        
        
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        vector<int> curr;
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        
        subSet1(0, nums, curr, ans);
        
        return ans;
    }
};

```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(2^N)

### Space Complexity: O(2^N*k)
