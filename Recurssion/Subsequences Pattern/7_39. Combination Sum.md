# 39. Combination Sum

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

## Approach
1. Implement take or not take senario, if you take an element then push element to curr array and decrement element from target and call the function recrssively without decreasing the index, because we have option to take an element unlimited times

2. If not take case, simply reduce the index and call the fucntion
3. return the unique combination subsequences

```Java

class Solution {
public:
    
    void combination(int index, int target, vector<int> &candidates, vector<int> &curr, vector<vector<int>> &ans) {
        
        if(index == candidates.size()) {
            if(target == 0) {
                ans.push_back(curr);
            }
            
            return;
        }
        
        if(candidates[index] <= target) {
            
            curr.push_back(candidates[index]);
            combination(index, target - candidates[index], candidates, curr, ans);
            curr.pop_back();
        }
        
        combination(index+1, target, candidates, curr, ans);
        
        
        
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        vector<int> curr;
        
        combination(0, target, candidates, curr, ans);
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};

```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(2^t * k) where t is the target, k is the average length

**Reason**: Assume if you were not allowed to pick a single element multiple times, every element will have a couple of options: pick or not pick which is 2^n different recursion calls, also assuming that the average length of every combination generated is k. (to put length k data structure into another data structure)

Why not (2^n) but (2^t) (where n is the size of an array)?

Assume that there is 1 and the target you want to reach is 10 so 10 times you can “pick or not pick” an element.

### Space Complexity: O(k*x), k is the average length and x is the no. of combinations
