# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

## Approach - 1 - Brute Force Approach

1. The obvious brute force solution is to pick all possible starting and ending positions for a substring, and verify if it is a palindrome.
2. There are a total of n^2 such substrings (excluding the trivial solution where a character itself is a palindrome).
3. Pick a starting index for the current substring which is every index from 0 to n-2.
4. Now, pick the ending index for the current substring which is every index from i+1 to n-1.
5. Check if the substring from ith index to jth index is a palindrome.
6. If step 3 is true and length of substring is greater than maximum length so far, update maximum length and maximum substring.
7. Print the maximum substring.

```Java

class Solution {

    private boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
        int low = 0, high = str.length() - 1;

        while(low < high) {
            if(str.charAt(low) != str.charAt(high)) return false;

            low ++;
            high--;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {

        if(s.length() <= 1) return s;

        int n = s.length();

        String ans = s.substring(0, 1);
        int maxLen = 1;

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j=i+maxLen; j < n; j++) {

                if(j - i > maxLen && isPalindrome(s.substring(i, j))) {
                    maxLen = j - i;
                    ans = s.substring(i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

```

## Approach: 2 - Expand Around Center

1. To enumerate all palindromic substrings of a given string, we first expand a given string at each possible starting position of a palindrome and also at each possible ending position of a palindrome and keep track of the length of the longest palindrome we found so far
2. At starting we have maz_str = s[0] and max_len = 1 as every single character is a palindrome.
3. Now, we will iterate over the string and for every character we will expand around its center.
4. For odd length palindrome, we will consider the current character as the center and expand around it.
5. For even length palindrome, we will consider the current character and the next character as the center and expand around it.
6. We will keep track of the maximum length and the maximum substring.
   Print the maximum substring.

```Java

class Solution {

    private String expandCenter(String s, int low, int high) {
        while(low >= 0 && high < s.length() && s.charAt(low) == s.charAt(high)) {
            low--;
            high++;
        }

        return s.substring(low + 1, high);
    }

    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {

        int n = s.length();

        if(n <= 1) return s;

        String ans = s.substring(0, 1);

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            String odd = expandCenter(s, i, i);
            String even = expandCenter(s, i, i+1);

            if(odd.length() > ans.length()) {
                ans = odd;
            }

            if(even.length() > ans.length()) {
                ans = even;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

## Approach : 3 - DP

1. To improve over the brute force solution, we first observe how we can avoid unnecessary re-computation while validating palindromes. Consider the case "ababa".
2. If we already knew that "bab" is a palindrome, it is obvious that "ababa" must be a palindrome since the two left and right end letters are the same.
3. We initialize a boolean table dp and mark all the values as false.
4. We will use a variable max_len to keep track of the maximum length of the palindrome.
5. We will iterate over the string and mark the diagonal elements as true as every single character is a palindrome.
6. Now, we will iterate over the string and for every character we will expand around its center.
7. For odd length palindrome, we will consider the current character as the center and expand around it.
8. For even length palindrome, we will consider the current character and the next character as the center and expand around it.
9. We will keep track of the maximum length and the maximum substring.
10. Print the maximum substring.

```Java

class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int start = 0, end = 0, maxLen= 1;
        int n = s.length();
        boolean dp[][] = new boolean[n][n];

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = true;

            for(int j=0; j<i; j++) {
                if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (i - j <=2 || dp[j+1][i-1])) {

                    dp[j][i] = true;
                    if(i - j + 1 > maxLen) {
                        maxLen = i - j + 1;
                        start = j;
                        end = i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }
}

```
