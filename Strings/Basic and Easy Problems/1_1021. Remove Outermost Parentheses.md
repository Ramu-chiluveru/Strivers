# 1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-outermost-parentheses/)

## Approach - 1

1. Declare a stack and traverse the string
2. If the size of the stack size is zero and current character is `(`, then it is outer most parenthesis. So if the stack size is greater than zero, then add current character to answer
3. If the size of the stack is one and current character is `)` and on the top of the stack the character is `(`, then this is outermost parenthesis. So if the stack size is greater than one, then add the current character to answer
4. return the answer

```Java

class Solution {
public:
    string removeOuterParentheses(string s) {

        string res = "";

        int count = 0;

        for(int i=0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if(s[i] == '(' && count++ > 0) {
                res += s[i];
            }

            else if(s[i] == ')' && count-- > 1) {
                res += s[i];
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};

```
