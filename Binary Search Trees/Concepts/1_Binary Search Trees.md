**Binary Search Trees**, popularly known as BST, are the category of Binary Trees used to optimize the operation of searching an element among the Tree Nodes in a Binary Tree.

**For every Binary Search if left and right sub-tree exist, then**

```txt

Left Child < Node < Right Child

```

1. In BST, the maximum height in almost all cases is kept in order of **log(N)2**
2. Binary Tree whose maximum height can reach the order of **N** when the tree is **skewed**.

**The Binary Search Trees, inorder traversal gives us sorted (ascending) order.**
