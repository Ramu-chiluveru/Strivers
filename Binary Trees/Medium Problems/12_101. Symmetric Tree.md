# 101. Symmetric Tree

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

## Approach - 1

1. To find the given tree is symmetric or not
2. if the given root is null then return true
3. Consider, the root->left is a tree and root->right is another tree
4. Based on the two trees, check if they are identical in structure and values or not
5. But we need to take care of,
   - if we go to the left side in first tree, then in second tree we need go to the right side
   - if we go to the right side in first ree, then in second tree we need to go to the left side
6. take care of base conditions
7. return the answer

```c++

class Solution {

    static boolean helper(TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        if(left == null || right == null) {
            return left == right;
        }

        if(left.val != right.val) return false;

        return helper(left.right, right.left) && helper(left.left, right.right);
    }

    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return root == null || helper(root.left, root.right);
    }
}

```

## Complexitiy Analysis:

### Time Complexity : O(N)

### Space Compleixty : O(H)
