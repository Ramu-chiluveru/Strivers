# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

## Approach - 1

1. If we have curr left node to the current, then find the precedesor for the current
2. Then precedesor->right = curr->right
3. curr->right = curr->left
4. curr->left = NULL
5. curr = curr->right
6. else curr left is null, simply do curr = curr->right

```c++

class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {

        TreeNode *curr = root;

        while(curr) {
            if(curr->left == NULL) {
                curr = curr->right;
            }

            else {
                TreeNode *prev = curr->left;

                while(prev->right) {
                    prev = prev ->right;
                }

                prev->right = curr->right;
                curr->right = curr->left;
                curr->left = NULL;
                curr = curr->right;

            }
        }
    }
};

```
