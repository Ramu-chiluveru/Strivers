# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

## Approach - 1

1. The main idea to find the LCA of a binary tree is
2. First observation is
   - The given two nodes will be in left sub-tree
   - or in right sub-tree
   - or one in left sub-tree and one in right sub-tree
3. The base case is that,
   - if the root is null return root
   - if the root is equal to P return root
   - if the root is equal to q return root
4. Call recurssively left-subtree left = func(root.left)
5. Call recurssively right-subtree right = func(root.right)
6. Here, we need to consider is that
   - if the right is equals to NULL means (any of two nodes not present in right sub-tree, then return left)
   - if the left is equals to Null means (any of two nodes not present in left sub-tree, then return right)
   - if left and right have something, then return the node
7. return the lowest common ancestor of the binary tree

```c++

class Solution {
public:

    TreeNode* helper(TreeNode *root, TreeNode *p, TreeNode *q) {
        if(root == NULL || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }

        TreeNode *left = helper(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode *right = helper(root->right, p, q);

        if(left == NULL) return right;

        else if(right == NULL) return left;

        else return root;
    }

    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {

        return helper(root, p, q);
    }
};

```
