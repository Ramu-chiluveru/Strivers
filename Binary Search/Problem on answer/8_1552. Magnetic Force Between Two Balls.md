## 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/)

**This problem is exactly similar to Aggresive cows**

## Approach - 1 - Brute Force Approach

1. Our answer may lie in the range of [1, max(arr) - min(arr)]
2. Traverse the loop in the range, for every element check Can we place the cows?
3. If we can place the cows, then check for other dist(element)
4. If we can't place the cows, then return the (element - 1)
5. In CanWePlace function
   - use two variables, `placedCount` and `lastPlaced` which help us to find the count the number of placed cows. lastPlaced tells that at which position we placed the cow prevously
   - Find the distance between lastPlaced and currentPosition, if the dist is greater than or equal to the required distance(element) then increment placedCount by 1
   - return true if we can place all the cows otherwise return false

```Java

public static boolean canWePlace(int[] stalls, int dist, int cows) {
    int n = stalls.length; //size of array
    int cntCows = 1; //no. of cows placed
    int last = stalls[0]; //position of last placed cow.
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (stalls[i] - last >= dist) {
            cntCows++; //place next cow.
            last = stalls[i]; //update the last location.
        }
        if (cntCows >= cows) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
    int n = stalls.length; //size of array
    //sort the stalls[]:
    Arrays.sort(stalls);

    int limit = stalls[n - 1] - stalls[0];
    for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
        if (canWePlace(stalls, i, k) == false) {
            return (i - 1);
        }
    }
    return limit;
}

```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(limit \* N)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Approach - 2 - Optimal Approach - Using Binary Search

1. As we know the search space, [1, max(arr) - min(arr)].
2. use two pointers and for every mid, check canWePlace the cows or not
3. If we can place, then MinMax the mid and then eliminate the left half
4. If we can't place, then eliminate the right half
5. return the answer

```Java

public static boolean canWePlace(int[] stalls, int dist, int cows) {
    int n = stalls.length; //size of array
    int cntCows = 1; //no. of cows placed
    int last = stalls[0]; //position of last placed cow.
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (stalls[i] - last >= dist) {
            cntCows++; //place next cow.
            last = stalls[i]; //update the last location.
        }
        if (cntCows >= cows) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
    int n = stalls.length; //size of array
    //sort the stalls[]:
    Arrays.sort(stalls);

    int low = 1, high = stalls[n - 1] - stalls[0];
    //apply binary search:
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (canWePlace(stalls, mid, k) == true) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return high;
}

```

### Time Complexity: O(N \* Log (limit))

### Space Complexity: O(1)
