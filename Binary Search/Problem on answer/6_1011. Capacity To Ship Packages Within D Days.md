# 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

## Approach - 1 - Brute Force

1. First let's find the search space for it, the minimum weight is always the max element of the array and maximum weight is always the sum of array elements
2. Traverse from the minimum weight to maximum weight, and check for every weight is it possible to ship the weights by `days` if it is return the answer

```Java

 public static int findDays(int[] weights, int cap) {
        int days = 1; //First day.
        int load = 0;
        int n = weights.length; //size of array.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (load + weights[i] > cap) {
                days += 1; //move to next day
                load = weights[i]; //load the weight.
            } else {
                //load the weight on the same day.
                load += weights[i];
            }
        }
        return days;
    }

    public static int leastWeightCapacity(int[] weights, int d) {
        //Find the maximum and the summation:
        int maxi = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            sum += weights[i];
            maxi = Math.max(maxi, weights[i]);
        }

        for (int i = maxi; i <= sum; i++) {
            if (findDays(weights, i) <= d) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        //dummy return statement:
        return -1;
    }

```

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(N \* X) where X => sum - max(arr)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Approach - 2

1. Instead of linearly searching from max(arr) to sum
2. Let's use binary search on the search space max(arr) to sum
3. For every mid, find the number of days it can take, if days is less than or equal to given days then find minimum of all possiblities
4. return the answer

```Java

class Solution {
public:

    int findPossible(vector<int>& weights, int days, int mid) {
        int day = 1;
        int totalWeight = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<weights.size(); i++) {
            if(totalWeight + weights[i] > mid) {
                totalWeight = weights[i];
                day++;
            }

            else {
                totalWeight += weights[i];
            }
        }

        return day;
    }

    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
       int maxEle = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());

       int totalSum = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);

       int low = maxEle, high = totalSum, ans = totalSum;

       while(low <= high) {
           int mid = (low + high) >> 1;

           int noOfDays = findPossible(weights, days, mid);


           if(noOfDays <= days) {
               ans = min(ans, mid);
               high = mid-1;
           }

           else {
               low = mid + 1;
           }
       }

       return ans;
    }
};
```
