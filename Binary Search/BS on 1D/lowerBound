#Title: LowerBound or floor in a sorted array

n = 7
x = 5 
arr[] = {1,2,8,10,11,12,19}

what is a floor or lower bound?
It is defined as the largest element k in arr[] such that k is smaller than or equal to x

#Approach 1:

Traverse the array from the 0th index and check whether that 
element is lesser than x and maximum of all the traversed elements

#Time complexity: O(n)
#space complexity: O(1)

#Approch 2:

On the basis of binary search algorithm
let low = 0
high = n-1

First target: we need to findout the element which is smaller than x
so, calculate mid = (low+high)/2

-> if the mid value is greater than the x. ignore the part from the high portion
so, move the high pointer to mid - 1

-> if the mid value is less than the x. store the index as ans and move
the low pointer to mid + 1 in search of the larger element

##code

int lt = 0 , rt = n-1;
int ans = -1;
        
while(lt <= rt)
{
      int mid = (lt+rt)/2;
         
      if(arr[mid] > x)
      {
            rt = mid-1;
      }
      else{
            ans = mid;
            lt = mid+1;
      }
}        
return ans;
