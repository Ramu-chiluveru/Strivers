# 75. Sort Colors

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

## Approach - 1

1. Simply use in-built sort funcitons

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(N \* log N)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Approach - 2

1. Count the number of zero's, one's and two's
2. Iterate till zero's and make the prefix subarray as zero
3. Then make followed elements as 1 till size one's count
4. After that two's element

- 0 1 0 1 2 1 => 0's = 2, 1's = 3 and 2's = 1

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(2\*N)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Approach - 3 - Use pointers

1. We can solve this problem with three pointers
2. One is left pointer which points to the number 1, it will ensure that all the number's before this left pointer are zero's
3. Other is right pointer which points to previous index of two element, It will ensure that all the elements after this pointer are two elements only
4. The middle pointer is used to perform operations to sort the array 000...111...222

```Java

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size() -1;

        while(mid <= high) {

            if(nums[mid] == 0) {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[low]);
                low++;
                mid++;
            }

            else if(nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            }

            else {
                swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);

                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};

```
