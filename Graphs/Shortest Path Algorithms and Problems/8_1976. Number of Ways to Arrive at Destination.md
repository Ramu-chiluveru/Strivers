# 1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-arrive-at-destination/)

## Approach - 1

1. For a destination node, let say we have 3 paths to reach the destination node from it's level 1 nodes.
2. If the paths leads to destination with same distance, we may declare that, out answer is three. But this is wrong.
3. For every node's at level 1 from destination,there might be more than one path to each node.
   \
   -- a -- dest
   /
4. Here we see that, there are three paths to reach `a`, then there should also three ways to reach destination from `a`.
5. This observation will help us to solve this question.
6. In this question we use Dijskshra's algo(using min-heap, distance array) and with one more array, `ways` array(Which tells in how many ways we can reach a node)
7. If we get the shortest distance than previous, then update distance and as well
   assign ways[child] = ways[node], and push to the priority queue with the distance and child node
8. If we get the equal distance, then increment the ways like ways[child] += ways[node]
9. After the completion of algorithm, return the ways[n-1] which is our answer

```c++

#define pr pair<long long, int>
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    int countPaths(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {

        vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n];

        for(auto road : roads) {
            adj[road[0]].push_back({road[1], road[2]});
            adj[road[1]].push_back({road[0], road[2]});
        }

        priority_queue<pr, vector<pr>, greater<pr>> mheap;

        vector<long long> dist(n, LLONG_MAX);
        vector<long long> ways(n, 0);

        dist[0] = 0;
        ways[0] = 1;

        mheap.push({0, 0});

        while(!mheap.empty()) {
            auto prr = mheap.top();
            mheap.pop();

            long long distance = prr.first;
            int node = prr.second;

            for(auto adjNode : adj[node]) {
                int child = adjNode.first;
                long long time = adjNode.second;

                if(distance + time < dist[child]) {
                    dist[child] = distance + time;
                    ways[child] = ways[node];
                    mheap.push({dist[child], child});
                }

                else if(distance + time == dist[child]) {
                    ways[child] = (ways[child] + ways[node])%mod;
                }
            }
        }

        return ways[n-1]%mod;

    }
};
