# 🚀 Welcome to My DSA Notes Repository!  

Hey there! 👋  

If you're on a journey to learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, you're in the right place. This repository is my personal collection of solved problems, structured notes, and explanations. I believe that **writing and organizing notes properly helps in learning faster and remembering longer**.  

## 📖 Why This Repository?  
When I first started learning DSA, I struggled to recall what I had learned. Writing in a notebook wasn’t working for me. So, I created this GitHub repository to **keep my notes organized, accessible anytime, and easy to revise**.  

Now, I want to share this with **you** so that it can help others too! You can **learn from my notes**, **use them for quick revision**, and even **contribute by adding your own solutions**.

## 🛠 How to Use This Repository?  
Each problem follows a **structured approach** to make learning easier:  

1️⃣ **Approach** – A step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem. You can also include images or diagrams to make it even easier to grasp.

2️⃣ **Code** –  Solve the problem on **LeetCode**, **GFG**, or any coding platform, then paste the tested code here.

3️⃣ **Time Complexity** – A clear analysis of time and space complexity for each approach.  

You can also include **multiple approaches** (Brute Force, Better, and Optimal) for a single problem, so you can understand different ways to solve a problem.
