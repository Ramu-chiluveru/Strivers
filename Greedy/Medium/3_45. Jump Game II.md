# 45. Jump Game II

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

## Approach - 1

1. It is same as Jump Game problem, but we need to find the minimum jumps to reach the last index
2. For every, index find the maximum reach(index) from that index and maximize it
3. To know minimum steps,
   - Take a lastJump variable, which tells preiously till where we jumped
   - if this lastJump is equal to the `i`, it means we used a jump
   - so increment the answer
   - assign lastJump = maxJump
4. return the answer

```c++

class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans, maxJump, lastJump;
        ans = maxJump = lastJump = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
            maxJump = max(maxJump, i + nums[i]);

            if(i == lastJump) {
                lastJump = maxJump;
                ans++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

```
